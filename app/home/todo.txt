INIT BETA LAUNCH (i.e. replace existing page)
- Add loading symbols
- Test it all and make sure user friendly / accurate calculations

ACTUAL LAUNCH
- Sign up / Register / Login flow
- Goal Setting / Tracking? Needs thinking / logic
- Add Charts
- Sign up / Login
- Add subscription option
- Hide Features behind subscription




- Add settings UI
- Add Activity Level to Metrics? Use in MBR?
  - not sure if it's needed in MBR, mostly in suggestions
    - i.e. If your activity level is at max and you platued, time to deload
- Test adding new user and functionality
  - test it works, measure correct, and UI is fluid and not buggy




- NOTE: I think I can replace the 2 week Avg Cals with the Calculated MBR, since is is more useful to the user.
    - and closer to the actual MBR of the person
- Make it functional and comparable to what exists today
    - i.e. Add in Settings
- Clean up code and TEST, code is sloppy right now
    - Make UI friendly and notify when missing data, did not save, etc.
- User Registration/Login
- Then the fun stuff
    - Can show daily surplus / deficit
    - MIght need to show 3 days on dash board
        - Today, Tomorrow, Yesterday
        - Maybe can simplify dashboard, Show:
            - Todays Avg. Weight, Yesterdays Avg. weight, and daily diff?
            - Yesterdays MBR (i.e. just call it MBR), and Today's once intake added, and daily diff
            - Todays Suggested intake (i.e. the prev days suggestion)
            - Tomorrows suggested intake
    - Make some features premium
        - Charts, Date changing, suggestions/goals, etc.
        - 2 Charts needed
          - Sum of Averaged Weight change
          - Sum of Cal Intake minus MBR
          - These charts should trend similar
